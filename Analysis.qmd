## 

## Target estimands

Our target estimand is the causal risk difference. We will also create cumulative incidence curves.

## Naive analysis

Does not take into account the grace period. The treatment is Agrace, meaning started at some point in the grace period.

```{r}
#| output: false

# Set up the seed 
rm(list=ls())
set.seed (04192020)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

df <- read_csv("CWC_example.csv")
```

## 

Intention to treat (ITT)

```{r}

m1 <- glm(D ~ Agrace + W + X + time_period, data=df, family="binomial")
tidy(m1)
```
