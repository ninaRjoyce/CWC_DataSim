## The simulation

The goal is to simulate data that can be used to examine the Clone-Weight-Censor (CWC) method. Thus, we need a data set with the following properties.

-   **Longitudinal:** A panel data set with enough time periods to allow for some complexity in the grace period and censoring patterns.

-   **A treatment strategy that is:**

    -   **Sustained -** A treatment that can hypothetically change over time (e.g., not a surgery)

    -   **Time varying -** A treatment that can turn on or off. To keep it simple we will have the treatment turn on or off one time at most.

    -   **Subject to possible immortal time bias:** The Cain, et al. paper uses a dynamic treatment regime. We will simulate something much simpler - a treatment strategy with a grace period.

-   **Non-random censoring:** We need censoring to occur both in and outside the grace period.

### Simulate longitudinal data

We'll start with 1,000 individuals, 10 time periods, and a grace period of 4 time periods. There will be two baseline covariates, X and W.

```{r}
#| output: false
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(04192020)

# Number of individuals
N <- 1000

# Number of time periods
J <- 10

# Grace period
G <- 4

# ID numbers
ID <- seq(1:N)

# Simulate baseline confounders
X <- rbinom(N, 1, 0.3)
W <- rbinom(N, 1, 0.7)
```

### Simulate exposure

Next, we will simulate the exposure. We will define treatment strategy as "initiate treatment within first four time periods and stay on treatment through time period 10", and "do not initiate treatment within the first four time periods and remain off treatment through time period 10."

We will assume that everyone "randomized" to the treatment strategy initiates within the first four time periods and thus any non-compliance with treatment strategy is due to initiation or discontinuation after the grace period.

We start by modeling the probability of initaiting the treatment in the grace period and then assign probabilities of switching in each time period after the grace period. Note that this variable, Agrace, is like our "new user" "never user" variable, because it indicates who initiated within the grace period.

```{r}

# Simulate treatment initiation in the grace period (yes/no)
Agrace <- rbinom(N, 1, plogis(-1 + 3*X - 2*W))

# For all individuals who initiate, randomly assign treatment to start within grace period
Astart <- ifelse(Agrace==1, sample(1:4, N, replace=T), NA)

# Create indicator of time period in which exposure changes for all A (must occur after the grace period)
Aswitch <- sample(5:11, N, prob = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.78), replace=T)
```

### Create "long" data set

Next, put all the variables together and expand the data set to a long data set, creating a time-period indicator

```{r}

#note: usually would do all these in one step, but keeping them separate (i.e., df.1-6) for illustration purposes
# Create a dataframe 
df.1 <- data.frame(ID, Agrace, Astart, Aswitch, X, W) 


# Expand to long
df.2 <- df.1 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  slice(rep(1:n(), each = J)) %>%
  mutate(time_period = 1:n())%>%
  ungroup()
```

### Create time-varying exposure

Create an indicator variable, A, for the time varying treatment. Note that A will be equal to Aever except in the time periods before initiation (when Astart\<time_period) and after switching (when Aswitch\>= time_period)

```{r}
# Create A - time varying indicator of treatment
df.3 <- df.2 %>%
  mutate(A = ifelse((time_period >= Astart | is.na(Astart)) & time_period< Aswitch, Agrace, 1-Agrace)) %>%
  select(ID, time_period, Agrace, A, W, X)

```

### Simulate outcomes

Simulate a probability distribution for the outcome that is a function of time (and the treatment and confounders). Note that the probability of the outcome is **not** contingent on not yet having experienced the outcome, though we drop all observations (or set to NA) after the first occurrence of the outcome.

```{r}

# Create hazard probabilities that increase with time *linearly*
A <- df.3$A
time_period <- df.3$time_period 

df.4 <- df.3 %>% 
  mutate(hazard_prob =  plogis(3 - (2 * A) + (0.03 * time_period) + (0.3 * X) - (0.4 * W)),
         uncens_prob = plogis(4 + (0.5 * A) + (0.008 * time_period) - (2 * X)))

# Survival indicator for each person-period that is a function of X, W and A (above)
surv <- rbinom(N*J, size=1, prob=df.4$hazard_prob)

# Censoring indicator for each person period taht is a function of only A and X 
uncens <- rbinom(N*J, size=1, prob=df.4$uncens_prob)

df.5 <- cbind(df.4, surv, uncens) 

# By group, arrange so that the first time survival or censoring equal zero is the first observation.
# select that time period and rename it
surv.time <- df.5 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  arrange(surv, time_period, .by_group=TRUE) %>%
  filter(row_number() ==1 & surv==0) %>%
  select(ID, time_period) %>%
  rename(event_time=time_period)

uncens.time <- df.5 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  arrange(uncens, time_period, .by_group=TRUE) %>%
  filter(row_number() ==1 & uncens==0) %>%
  select(ID, time_period) %>%
  rename(cens_time=time_period)

# Merge back on to dataset and drop (or set to NA) all observations that occur after the outcome
# and replace all outcomes for individuals who never have the event (i.e., surv=1 for all time points) with zero.
df.6 <- df.5 %>%
  left_join(surv.time, by="ID") %>%
  left_join(uncens.time, by="ID") %>%
  
  #fill in missing times with J+1 for relative time statments below
  mutate(event_time = ifelse(is.na(event_time), J+1, event_time),
         cens_time = ifelse(is.na(cens_time), J+1, event_time),
    
         D = ifelse(is.na(event_time), 0, 
                    ifelse(event_time>time_period, 0,
                           ifelse(event_time==time_period, 1, NA))),
         C = ifelse(is.na(cens_time), 0,
                    ifelse(cens_time>time_period, 0,
                           ifelse(cens_time==time_period, 1, NA))),
         end_time = pmin(event_time, cens_time, J),
         
         # Y is the outcome when there is censoring, D is the outcome without censoring
         # note that when censoring and event occur at teh same time, censoring "wins"
         Y = ifelse( end_time < time_period, NA,
                     ifelse(cens_time<=event_time, 0, D)))
           

# Select relevant variables for clean dataset
df <- df.6 %>%
  select(-hazard_prob, -uncens_prob, -event_time, -cens_time, -end_time, -surv, -uncens ) 
 
# Export to .csv for sharing
write_csv(df, file="CWC_example.csv")
```

## Summarize data

Summary of exposure and confounders

```{r}
df %>% filter(time_period==1) %>% summarize(mean(Agrace), mean(X), mean(W))

df %>% filter(time_period==1) %>% group_by(Agrace) %>% summarize(mean(X), mean(W))

```

Distribution of follow up time

```{r}
df.max <- df %>% group_by(ID) %>% summarize(time_period=max(time_period), Y=max(Y), Agrace=max(Agrace)) 

table(df.max$time_period)
```

Outcome by exposure (Agrace) status

```{r}
df.max %>% group_by(Agrace) %>% summarize(mean(Y))
```

Potential for immortal time bias: How many outcomes occur in the "exposed group" (Agrace) before they are actually exposed (i.e., when Agrace=1 and A=0)?

```{r}
df %>% filter(Agrace==1 & A==0 & Y==1) %>% summarize(sum(Y))
```

## Naive analysis

We'll start by doing the naive analysis, where we first just compare the crude risks, and then
